# Repository Instructions

## Project Context

This repository was generated from `ai-ready-modern-python-template`.
Keep project-specific behavior in committed source files and avoid weakening
shared quality gates without documenting the reason.

## Commands

- `mise install`: install mise-managed tools.
- `mise run install`: install Python project dependencies.
- `mise run lint-fast`: run edit-safe lint targets for active development.
- `mise run lint`: run the full lint gate used by CI.
- `mise run lint-full`: explicit name for the full lint gate.
- `mise run format`: apply Ruff formatting and autofixes for `src`.
- `mise run test`: run the pytest suite under `tests`.
- `mise run test-cov`: run the pytest suite with a coverage report.
- `mise run install-hooks`: install prek-managed pre-commit and pre-push hooks.

## Tooling

- Use `jaq` instead of `jq` for JSON command-line work.
- Python dependency and command execution goes through `uv`.
- Project task orchestration and native CLI tooling go through `mise.toml`;
  run `mise install` before invoking native linters directly.

- Node-based lint CLIs are pinned in `mise.toml` through mise's npm backend
  and installed with `mise install`.


## Workflow

- Prefer the existing `mise run` tasks before invoking tools directly.
- Follow `docs/lint-strategy.md` for lint group placement and command
  selection.
- Do not make lint or test tasks silently pass when configured paths are
  missing; restore the path or update the configuration instead.
- Temporary ad hoc tests are fine while developing or debugging. Remove them
  before committing; only tests that verify actual product behavior should stay
  in git history.
- Keep generated or project-specific automation out of shared config unless the
  supporting scripts are committed too.
